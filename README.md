# TdsTest

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3.

# Test specific instructions

As this repo is publicly available, this code test *does not* have an api key set and will not work until it is set. Apologies for the inconvenience, but as a junior dev I once pushed a credential to a public repo for a code test and was instantly failed for doing so...
If this is a problem, let me know asap.

To set the api key, navigate to `src/environments/environment.ts` and replace `your-api-key` with your value. 

If you don't have one, you can get one here [https://currencybeacon.com](https://currencybeacon.com/register)

Clone the repo and run `npm install` in the root directory

If all goes well you should be able to run `npm run start` and navigate to `localhost:4200`


# My approach

I took a few hours to do this test. I wrote it with the intention of displaying some knowledge of the following:

* typescript
* NgRx
* RxJs
* lazy loading
* reactive forms
* Angular material

There is much, much more that I would have done, such as more comprehensive unit testing. The design is non-existent really, I wasn't concentrating on that for this task.

I did not use any AI tools such as OpenAi or Anthropic for any of this test, but did a bit of stack overflow / googling and referred to the material docs a fair bit.
